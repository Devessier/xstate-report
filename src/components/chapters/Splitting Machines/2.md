### Composing logic

People also compose machines by creating higher-order functions, like a `createRetryMachine`.

**31%** of respondents declare creating **mixin functions to compose machines**.

With XState v4, developers found it quite cumbersome to do so.

The Stately team understood that composing actors was difficult with XState v4.

They worked on a unified API for actors in XState v5, whatever their type is (a promise actor, a callback actor, an observable, or a machine). For instance, to define a callback actor, we must do so through a `fromCallback` function which will return the same object as the `fromPromise` function used to create a promise actor.

That way, composing actors will be so much easier. Here is an example taken from the documentation:

```tsx
function withLogging(actorLogic) {
  const enhancedLogic = {
    ...actorLogic,
    transition: (state, event, actorCtx) => {
      console.log('State:', state);
      return actorLogic.transition(state, event, actorCtx);
    },
  };

  return enhancedLogic;
}

const loggingToggleLogic = withLogging(toggleLogic);
```
