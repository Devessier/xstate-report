According to the results of my survey, XState developers are scared of creating and maintaining big state machines: **nobody** declared making state machines with **more than 50 states**.

Conversely, **59%** of respondents reported creating state machines with **less than ten states**.

Creating small state machines does not mean XState developers only use XState to solve less complex issues: **86%** of respondents make **separate machines for independent behaviors**.

One major foundation of XState is the *actor model* — pieces of logic communicate and can not mutate the state of others; they need to send *events*.

Solving complex problems with XState usually means finding which parts of a system are independent of others to extract them and make them less constrained to a specific use case and more generic.

One great example is an actor to handle notifications or toasts. Notifications can be triggered from any part of an application: after checking out an item or when receiving a new message in a chat room.

If you are using XState to implement that instead of a library taking care of those things for you, you will have to:

- Choose if the application can show multiple notifications simultaneously or if they need to be queued or replaced by each other.
- Automatically hide notifications after a delay of inactivity, or make the notification permanent.
- Hide the notifications if the user clicks a *Cancel* button or swipes the notification like on iOS or macOS.
