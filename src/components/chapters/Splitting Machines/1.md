It would be better to avoid reimplementing this complex logic whenever you want to display a notification.

Furthermore, I assume you would like a global notifications store: you are good to go with a global actor to handle notifications!

Actors are not a shiny way to make code look smart: they are an excellent way to split code into business logic chunks.

Nick Worrall uses the actor model a lot. For him, the actor model is safer and prevents unwanted side effects from happening. He tries to keep his state machines as small as possible to scope independent behaviors. He prefers systems of 50 little state machines over machines with 50 states.

### Split generic features

We can not only split state machines by independent features but also split them to make some generic mechanisms reusable.

**37%** of respondents split machines into **reusable utility machines**.

A great example is a machine to fetch data. Fetching data seems trivial, but it becomes a lot more complex when implementing things like caching or revalidation that specialized tools like TanStack Query do.

The internal workings of [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) (previously known as React Query) are impressive and could be implemented as a state machine.

You wouldn't want to implement revalidation when the user re-focuses the window for every HTTP call you make inside your state machines. The smarter thing to do would be to extract this logic into a reusable `requestMachine` that could support any RPC protocol.
