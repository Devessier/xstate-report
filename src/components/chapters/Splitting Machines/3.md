### Executing actors

Splitting machines is one thing; making XState run them is another one.

To make XState run a split machine part of a system, we have two choices: invoking or spawning it.

**24%** of respondents declare to **invoke machine actors**, **89%** declare **invoking promise actors**, and **55%** say **invoking callback actors**.

At the same time, **63%** of respondents claimed to **spawn machines**, while **34%** declared **spawning promises** and **16%** declared **spawning callbacks**.

Machines are more spawned than invoked.

When invoking an actor, this actor is attached to the state it was invoked by: if the machine exits the state, the machine stops the actor.

While a spawned actor lives until the machine it was invoked by is stopped, living across state transitions and being more independent of its parent machine than an invoked machine.

To me, spawned machines are handy when dealing with a non-finite number of business entities, like a list of conversations. Each chat conversation might be a machine spawned from a parent machine holding all the references to these spawned machines inside its context.

I like to use invoked machines for machines that can only exist once in an application and those with a scoped lifetime to a specificÂ *state*.

If I were creating a video call application, I would invoke a `videoCallMachine` when my `appMachine` is in the `authenticated` state, as the user can start a video call at any time while being authenticated.
