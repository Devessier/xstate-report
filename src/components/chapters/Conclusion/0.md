Thank you for having read my report about the State of XState. I thank again all the people that contributed to this report.

I am Baptiste Devessier. I am a full-stack web and XState freelance consultant. When I am not consulting on freelance projects, you will find me writing articles, recording video tutorials, and working on my side projects.

I have been a passionate XState user since I first used it three years ago to implement the search bar of an e-commerce website, which included complex features to implement without XState, like debounced search-as-you-type.

XState and state machines are excellent tools to master, as they can ease solving complex problems. **Subscribe to my newsletter to learn how to use XState best.**
