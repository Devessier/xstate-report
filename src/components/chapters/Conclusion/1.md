I credit Tailwind Labs for the overall design of this document, for which I took inspiration from the Refactoring UI book.

This PDF document has been generated from an Astro website built with Svelte and Tailwind CSS with Typography plugin. I learned a lot about developing websites to be printed, and I wasn't expecting it to be so tricky at times.
