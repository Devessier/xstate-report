I thank again everyone who took the time to answer my survey and those who accepted to be interviewed.

I credit Tailwind Labs for the overall design of this document, for which I took inspiration from the Refactoring UI book.

This PDF document has been generated from an Astro website built with Svelte and Tailwind CSS with Typography plugin. I learned a lot about developing websites to be printed, and I wasn't expecting it to be so tricky at times.

I am grateful to Mia Combeau, Paul Rastoin, and Ã‰milie Phe, who reviewed the report and showed support at every step of the journey. Without them, the report wouldn't be as good, and I would be less confident to present it to you today.
