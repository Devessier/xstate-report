## [Splitting machines](#splitting-machines-chapter)

It is common for state machines to grow fast in size as adding more and more features. Splitting machines into smaller ones is a way to decouple independent blocks, as we do with separate functions. XStaters adopted several patterns to break their state machines and to be able to maintain complex systems of actors.

## [Testing with XState](#testing-chapter)

Testing usually leads to divergent opinions and is the same for testing XState machines. Some XStaters choose to unit-test their state machines. Others run integration or e2e tests that donâ€™t care about implementation details. Model-Based Testing is also a pattern used to improve the reliability of software.
