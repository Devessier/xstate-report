In this report, Iâ€™ll cover five topics that matter to XState developers.

## [Onboarding new developers](#onboarding-new-developers-chapter)

XState reports being hard to learn. Teams employ different methods to
teach XState to developers new to state machines. Reading XState
documentation, watching video courses, and giving modeling exercises are a
few ways to teach XState.

## [Modeling state machines](#modeling-state-machines-chapter)

Modeling is known to be the most complicated part of creating state
machines. Finding how to best solve a problem by modeling a state machine
is a skill that takes practice. Sometimes it may also be better to stick
to a simple solution using a more scoped tool instead of a state machine.

## [Types](#types-chapter)

Types are crucial for building scalable software. XState supports typing
machines. Throughout its history, XState has released different ways to
type state machines. People are not expecting the same level of
type-safety for their state machines, and they have their preferences
about the method to achieve it.
