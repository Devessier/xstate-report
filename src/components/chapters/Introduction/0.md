Thank you for downloading my report on the State of XState for 2023. This report details the most important areas of interest shared across the XState community, based on the responses I got to my survey and the interviews I conducted with the people willing to talk about their experience with XState.

Thirty-nine people responded to my survey, which took place between the 13th and 30th of May 2023. I contacted XState users before creating the survey to gather advice on which topics my final report should focus on. From the invaluable feedback received, I chose twenty questions for the survey. They focus on the subjects that XState developers want to learn about more from others in the industry.

I interviewed seven people who shared their feedback about XState with me. This feedback allowed me to provide real examples for all of the topics covered in the report.

I want to thank everybody who took the time to answer my emails, respond to the survey, and get interviewed. It matters a lot to me, so thank you! Their help made this report accurate on the current State of XState.
