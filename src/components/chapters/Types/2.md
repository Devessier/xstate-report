### Typing without type-generation feels more usual

Though the typegen helps deal with types, some people think it could be enhanced. People point out that it doesn’t yet work with all XState’s features, like eventless transitions and send action.

Some people find that using a typegen system is a bit hacky and would expect XState to provide strong types inference without dealing with an external tool.

[txstate](https://github.com/devanshj/txstate) is a project that tried to solve these problems without using a typegen system.

The possible issues with a system like `txstate` are that types become hard to maintain, and performances can become harmful, [as Mateusz Burzyński pointed out in a discussion on Stately’s Discord about `txstate`](https://discord.com/channels/795785288994652170/801135010265825300/803310193265082488):

Determining how XState should implement types without relying on type-generation led to many discussions on Stately’s Discord and in [GitHub Discussions in the XState repository](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate/discussions/2323#discussioncomment-899642).

### Community does not yet agree on typing machines

Typing state machines is definitely the most controversial subject about XState.

Only **59%** of the respondents use **typegen**, and **28%** type their machines by **providing types for the context and the events without using the typegen**. **15%** are **not typing their machines** at all, and **8%** still use **typestates**, though it was sort of deprecated.
