Read it carefully: not using typegen doesn’t mean unlinking XState!

Christian Grøngaard is taking benefit from XState so much, as it’s helping him to solve problems that would have been too hard to solve without it, that he is okay to don’t having fully typed machines. He even says, ironically, that *he wouldn’t know how to do frontend without XState now that he’s so used to it*.

There are not a lot of tools that lead to so much love! I don’t know if an artisan would say the same about his hammer.

### The future of typing XState machines

With XState v5, tools are coming to implement the *receptionist pattern* — a way to make actors across the hierarchy of machines communicate with each other directly.

People I interviewed hope there will be a way to create systems of actors fully typed so that actors, however they are deep in the actor tree, can send events to other actors in a typed way, that is, being able to send to an actor only events it’s expecting. Nothing would prevent creating safe huge systems of actors anymore.

I have been using typegen since it was released, and I’ve loved the type-safety it provides to my machines. The first thing I do when creating a new machine is enable the typegen on it.

I’m excited about the future of types with XState, dreaming of a way to type systems of actors fully.
