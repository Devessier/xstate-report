For a few years, TypeScript has established its supremacy over all other type systems for JavaScript.

All libraries provide TypeScript types, most directly written in TypeScript.

Application code is also heavily written in TypeScript, and developers expect all libraries to have strong types that make them more productive and more confident with the safety of their code.

XState complies with this rule and has provided several ways to type machines over time.

### The evolution of ways to type machines

#### 2019

In 2019, machines were defined through the `Machine` function. [Types were provided as three generics to the `Machine` function](http://web.archive.org/web/20190417082354/https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/typescript.html#using-typescript):

- The shape of the context
- A union of events handled by the machine
- The *state schema*, which was a nested object mapping all the states of the machine and allowed only predefined states to be declared in the machine

#### 2020

In 2020, the state schema was upgraded to become *typestates*, which allows declaring the shape of the context, depending on the state.

It will enable specifying that the data are not yet available in the `loading` state but are necessarily defined in the `succeed` state.

This is still in use in 2023 with XState v4, but itâ€™s no longer the recommended way to type machines.
