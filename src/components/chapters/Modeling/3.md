### Getting good at modeling

To get good at modeling, I think the best way is to start by reimplementing simple systems with XState: a little Tetris game you made, an authentication form, a wizard form.

I think it's easier to start reasoning about state machines through the reimplementation of visual and interactive applications.

Then, less obvious features like delayed transitions (after transitions) become more evident, allowing you to implement debouncing and throttling better than usual.

After some time using state machines, using XState for the state management of your applications becomes evident, and state machines proliferate quickly across your code base.

They can even reach your backend to drive your workflows.

This is how I learned XState, and I'm still constantly discovering new areas to use XState to solve complex problems.
