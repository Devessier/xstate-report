As I outlined in the first section about [Onboarding new developers](#onboarding-new-developers-chapter), learning how to model things is the most challenging part of learning XState overall. For each problem, there are several ways to model a state machine to solve it.

One of Chris Shank's hobbies is modeling: he helps people on Twitter and Stately's Discord to reason out statechart patterns applied to real-world problems.

You quickly see yourself modeling the behavior of objects from daily life, like a [microwave](https://finite-state-microwave.onrender.com/).

### Little state machines are favored

About modeling, one thing people asked was how big are other XState users' state machines. **59%** of the respondents create state machines with **less than ten states**, and **62%** create state machines with **between 10 and 49 states**.

Nobody declared making state machines with more than 50 states, and it surprised me quite a bit, as I sometimes do.

Creating mostly little state machines means solving more than just fundamental problems.

Christian Gr√∏ngaard writes a lot of little state machines to split independent parts of the logic into state machines that are easier to think about. He invokes and spawns these little machines and makes them communicate to implement the overall behavior.

Favoring little state machines over bigger ones is a trend shared across the community.
