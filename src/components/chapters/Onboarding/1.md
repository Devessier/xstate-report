My browser forces me to go to XState’s documentation when I type `xstate`.

Stately’s team is working on updating the documentation, which will now be live at [https://stately.ai/docs](https://stately.ai/docs).

Be sure to follow the work they’ll be doing there, as it will be amazing! However, my browser will have to learn the new URL of XState’s documentation.

### Learn with video courses

One new way to learn XState is through David Khourshid’s courses on Frontend Masters. At the time of writing, the most recent courses are about [State Machines in JavaScript with XState](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/xstate-v2/), and [State Modeling in React with XState](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/xstate-react/).

**44%** of respondents declare they ask newcomers to learn XState with Frontend Masters’ courses and others, like [Kyle Shevlin’s introduction to State Machines with XState](https://egghead.io/courses/introduction-to-state-machines-using-xstate).

I watched these courses and recommend them too; they are great ways to have an overview of XState’s API and modeling techniques, the two difficulties with learning XState.
