### Master XState by mixing different learning paths

My advice to onboard developers to XState would be to mix reading the documentation with watching courses and applying XState to real problems with your teammates.

Most of the respondents combine these ways of learning. If you are learning XState on your own, [Statelyâ€™s community is here to help you on Discord](https://discord.gg/xstate).

Learning by example suits many people, and the [XState Catalogue](https://xstate-catalogue.com/) remains a good reference.

It takes time to get good at XState, so take it slow!
