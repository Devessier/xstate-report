When discovering XState, most people also learn the foundational concepts
of XState: state machines, finite states, transitions, services,
statecharts, hierarchical states, etc.

Though the XState's API is complete and brings tools to solve advanced
issues, this is not learning the API of the library that takes the most of
the time, it's learning how to use it efficiently to model things
properly.

Many teams worldwide are using XState to develop software, and they are
all facing the same problem: **how to teach XState to other developers in the team and newcomers?**

On this aspect, XState does not resemble most of the libraries, like
React, TanStack Query, or date-fns, that solve a specific problem and are
well-bounded: XState, on its own, does *nothing*; it’s a tool that
allows expressing any logic declaratively and explicitly, and thus it can
be used to do *anything*.

The scope of XState is less identifiable, and it can be challenging for
people discovering XState to see its benefits.

### Learn with the documentation

**83%** of respondents to the survey declare to ask newcomers to read XState’s
documentation to learn XState.

It has been the official way to learn XState for a long time, and this is
how I learned XState. I visited [https://xstate.js.org/docs/](https://xstate.js.org/docs/) so much that my browser now forces me to go there when I type *xstate*.
