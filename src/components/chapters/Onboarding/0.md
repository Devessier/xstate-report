When discovering XState, most people also learn the foundational concepts of XState: state machines, finite states, transitions, services, statecharts, hierarchical states, etc.

Though XState's API is complete and offers tools to solve advanced issues, it is not learning the API of the library that takes most of the time; it's learning how to use it efficiently to model things properly.

Many teams worldwide are using XState to develop software, and they are all facing the same problem: **How to teach XState to other developers and newcomers in their team?**

On this aspect, XState does not resemble most of the libraries, like React, TanStack Query, or date-fns, that solve a specific problem and are well-bounded: XState, on its own, does *nothing*; it's a tool that allows expressing any logic declaratively and explicitly, and thus it can be used to do *anything*.

The scope of XState is less identifiable, and it can be challenging for people to see the benefits of XState at first.

### Learn with the documentation

**83%** of respondents to the survey declare asking newcomers to read XState's documentation to learn XState.

It has been the official way to learn XState for a long time, and this is how I learned XState. I visited [https://xstate.js.org/docs/](https://xstate.js.org/docs/) so much that my browser now forces me to go there when I type *xstate*.
