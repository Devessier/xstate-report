### Learn from your company's specificities

Another exciting way to learn XState is to understand it based on real scenarios from companies' problems.

Christian Gr√∏ngaard pair-programs with newcomers to teach them how to use XState to solve specific issues, and so do **67%** of the respondents.

Richard Seaman also bets on modeling exercises based on the company's business problems: newcomers have to model with XState a problem they already faced. **25%** of the respondents use **modeling exercises** to teach XState.

### Companies do teach XState to newcomers

Interestingly, **no respondent** said their team **requires XState skills to join it**, even if **21%** of respondents said they use XState for **most of their logic**, and **15%** use XState **everywhere**.

I wonder if we would get the same numbers if asking teams developing with React whether React is a required skill. It's mainly because XState developers are rarer than React developers, and training developers in XState is part of the hiring process.

But it's also due to XState being more versatile and used in many ways to solve various problems.

React is mainly used to build web and native apps with React Native, though it can also be used to [create CLI](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink).
