The difficulty with `@xstate/test` is that the amount of generated paths quickly grows exponentially as you add states and events.

`@xstate/test` for XState v4 exposes two functions to generate paths: `getShortestPathPlans` and `getSimplePathPlans`. `getSimplePathPlans` generates all paths to all other reachable states; `getShortestPathPlans` generates only the shortest path to all other reachable states.

For XState v4, I recommend using `getSimplePathPlans` with a machine kept as small as possible to test all the combinations without leading to 500 tests being generated.

The Stately team is working on improvements to `@xstate/test` for XState v5; we'll see where this interesting testing method goes!
