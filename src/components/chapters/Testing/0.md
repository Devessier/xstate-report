Testing is a controversial topic across the computing engineering industry: ask ten developers how they are testing their software, and they will all have different answers.

The testing vocabulary conveys different meanings based on who you are talking to. Integration and end-to-end tests are the same for some people; they are different testing practices for others.

Across the web development industry, teams have differing views on what parts of their front-end code they should test. Some teams mock side effects and test logic code separately; some do snapshots of the HTML nodes returned by their components in a mocked browser; others test production code on real browsers.

Unsurprisingly, respondents to the survey disagreed on ways to test XState machines.

### Unit tests

**37%** of the respondents are **unit testing** their machines.

For Marcin Cekiera, finding a quick and scalable way to unit test machines is challenging. He has struggled to avoid excessive boilerplate code required for testing machines.

Christian Grøngaard is also unit-testing his machines and has developed his pattern to test machines.

Unit testing machines mean mocking actors, like invoked promises, invoked callbacks, and spawned machines, to focus tests on the transitions that are taken by a machine when it receives an event in a specific state.

Unit testing machines efficiently ensures machines are not stuck nor reach impossible states. Actors are tested independently.
