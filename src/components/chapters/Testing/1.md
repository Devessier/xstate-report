Even though they are beneficial, unit tests should not be the only testing strategy a team uses, as these tests don't ensure separate blocks of code work properly together once assembled.

It's great to know that a window can be opened in isolation, but it's better to know it's openable in its real-world environment.

### Integration and e2e tests

Integration and e2e tests become useful to ensure that the separate parts of a system work together: with them, the whole system is tested, or at least a large part of it. I'm using [Kent C. Dodds' test classification](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/the-testing-trophy-and-testing-classifications), the Testing Trophy.

**71%** of the respondents use **integration and e2e testing** with XState.

Richard Seaman is testing his application's behavior through a user's eyes with integration and e2e tests. He runs more specific tests on actions and actors with unit tests. Both testing methods are complementary.

Alexandre Stahmer prefers to test the business logic of his state machines directly through e2e tests.
