Even though they are really helpful, unit tests should not be the single testing strategy of a team, as these tests don't ensure separate blocks of code work properly together once assembled.

It's great to know that a window can be opened in isolation, but it's better to know it's openable in its real environment.

### Integration and e2e tests

Integration and e2e tests become useful to ensure separate parts of a system work together: with them, the whole system is tested, or at least a big part. I'm using [Kent C. Dodds' test classification](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/the-testing-trophy-and-testing-classifications), the Testing Trophy.

**71%** of the respondents use **integration and e2e testing** with XState.

Richard Seaman is testing his application's behavior through the eyes of a user with integration and e2e tests. He runs more specific tests on actions and actors with unit tests. Both testing methods are complementary.

Alexandre Stahmer prefers to directly test the business logic of his state machines through e2e tests.
